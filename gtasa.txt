               CJ gets into a taxi.

               Police pull over the taxi. Tenpenny, Pulaski and Hernandez get
               out.

                         down on your stomach. There you
                         go.

               Hernandez cuffs CJ and takes his money

                                   TENPENNY
                         I'll take that Hernandez.

                         This is drug money.

                         Hell no, Officer Tenpenny. I was
                         just wondering what took y'all so
                         long.

               Tenpenny bangs CJ's head on the car as he's putting him in.

                         Looks like we backed them Ballas
                         against the wall, huh?

                         Officer Pulaski thinks you're

                         myself in a difficult moral
                         position, Carl.

                                   CJ

                         I like the status quo, Carl. I
                         like having all you bastards doing
                         my job for me - blowing each

                         unfair advantage over another,
                         that truly troubles me, Carl.

                         Carl, they watch the news. I'm
                         saying they're making friends,
                         cutting deals, and tooling up for
                         more than half-assed drive-bys.

                         Go check out a bust freight

                         But you're home now, partner -

                         Yeah, let's roll!

               Throughout Sweet's speech the homies were constantly agreeing.

                                   SWEET
                             (to CJ)

                         Yeah, my nigga... Alright, you go
                         get heated up, and I'll meet you
                         at the crossroads.

               CJ is outside Sweet's house, his phone rings.

               CJ and Cesar are in a car down an alleyway.

                                   CJ
                         So you dragged me way across town
                         to see... what?

                         Just in time, ese, take a good
                         hard look over there.

                         Just watch, homie.

               Ryder and Big Smoke come out of the door that the Ballas have
               just walked out of.

                                   CJ
                         What the fuck? Oh, no! Shit,

                         Ssshhh, ese, look at that ride...

               Big Smoke and Ryder pull open a garage door, Tenpenny is
               inside the garage along with a green Sabre.

                         poked around. I didn't believe it
                         myself but...

                         No, no, you did the right thing. I
                         owe you, Ces. I gotta go tell
                         Sweet about - Oh, fuck! Sweet!

                         a safe place!

                         What you thinking?

               Police close in on the battle. CJ holds his hands up in the

               CUT TO CJ, Tenpenny and Pulaski in a police car in the middle-
               of-nowhere. CJ has a bag over his head. Hernandez is outside
               the car having a piss.

                                   TENPENNY
                         You got a bag over you head, boy.
                         How you feel about that?

                         Oh, alright. But only because you
                         said please.

               Tenpenny takes the bag off CJ's head.

                         only sucking one grease-ball's
                         dick. Things are going pretty well

                         We want you to do a little favour
                         for us, Carl.

               CJ, Tenpenny and Pulaski are now outside of the police car.
               Hernandez is still pissing on the side of the road.

                                   CJ
                         I can't believe that nigga Smoke
                         turned on me.

                                   PULASKI
                         Smoke? Smoke does exactly what
                         he's told. He learned that lesson
                         a long time ago.

                                   TENPENNY
                         Homies for life? Street loyalty?
                         That's all bullshit, Carl. Didn't
                         you learn that when they ran you
                         out of town, just 'cause you let
                         Brian die? Huh? Eddie, I can't
                         deal with this guy. He's an idiot!

                         Let me air this fucker out, I...

               Pulaski shoves a gun in CJ's face.

                                   TENPENNY
                         No no no no no no no, Officer...
                         For once, let's let the kid do
                         something good with his useless
                         life. He's gonna help us with the
                         fight against crime. Right, Carl?

                                   PULASKI
                         Yeah. By any means necessary.

                                   TENPENNY
                         Now you stay the fuck away from
                         Smoke, and stay the fuck away from
                         us. Otherwise Sweet is going to
                         find himself on a Ballas block
                         getting in touch with his feminine
                         side. Hey Hernandez, you going to
                         piss all day?

                                   CJ
                             (to Pulaski)
                         Get your hands off me, man.

                                   PULASKI
                         For some reason, we've got a
                         little problem with a former
                         friend of ours, he seems to
                         disagree with some of our methods.

                                   CJ
                         Now who could do that?

                                   TENPENNY
                         Yeah, you'll never find anybody as
                         fork-tongued as this snake ass
                         bastard. Soon as he gets caught
                         with his hand in the cookie jar,
                         he'll whistle any tune Internal
                         Affairs want him to.

                                   PULASKI
                         See, they've got him hiding up
                         Mount Chiliad someplace, so they
                         can manipulate his testimony any
                         way they want to.

                                   TENPENNY
                         I want you to pay him a little
                         visit, Carl. And destroy all his
                         evidence before he testifies.

                                   PULASKI
                         Sort this out, Carl, so Officer
                         Tenpenny can sleep easy at night.
                         We want evidence he ain't gonna
                         talk.

                         and your heart will break in two.
                         But you are more like the spiny
                         lizard than a man. Goodbye!

               CJ is at a farm.

                                   CJ
                         Man, where is this guy?

               Cesar turns up.

                                   CJ
                         Hey, I've been waiting forever,
                         man. Where the hell you been?

                                   CESAR
                         Sorry, holmes, I had no idea when
                         the race would be.

                                   CJ
                         Riiight - you just happened to
                         show up five minutes after
                         everybody else, huh?

                                   CESAR
                         When the gasoline runs through
                         your veins like the burning
                         passion, you know when it's time
                         to race!

                                   CJ
                         I think you're getting high on
                         that country air, man!

               Woozie and three other people show up.

                                   CESAR
                         Hey, CJ, look...

                                   WOOZIE
                             (to CJ)
                         You haven't been to one of our
                         meets before, where you from,
                         friend?

                                   CJ
                         I'm from Grove Street Families,
                         Los Santos. What's happening?

                                   WOOZIE
                         Relax. This isn't a parade, pal.
                         But, you know, we gotta be
                         careful. Wu Zi Mu, but my friends
                         call me 'Woozie'. How you doing?

                                   CJ
                         Wha...? CJ. Carl Johnson.

                                   WOOZIE
                         Listen, out here we like to race
                         for cash or pink slips - racer's
                         choice. Get your car started,
                         we're about to go. Good luck, Carl
                         Johnson.

               Woozie and the other three people go.

                                   CJ
                             (to Cesar)
                         There's something real strange
                         about that dude, man.

                                   CESAR
                         Be careful CJ!

                                   CJ
                         For sure, man.

               ///MISSION\\\

               CJ pats a car.

                                   CJ
                         Oooh, yeah!

               Woozie and a woman come over to CJ.

                                   WOOZIE
                         You drive with style, Carl Johnson
                         - and I never mind losing to a guy
                         who's willing to push himself
                         right to the edge. As for me, I'm
                         a man who honours his bet.

                                   CJ
                         Well, you learn pretty fast with
                         the police on your ass.

                                   WOOZIE
                         Listen, it's best if we clear the
                         hell out of here as soon as
                         possible because, for some reason,
                         the local police don't appreciate
                         our noble sport.

                                   CJ
                         Yeah. Thanks for the advice.

                                   WOOZIE
                         OK, I gotta go. Uh, you know what?
                         If you ever find yourself in San
                         Fierro, give me a call, maybe we
                         can do a little business together.

               Woozie hands his card to CJ.

                                   CJ
                         Yeah, I might just do that.

               Police sirens can be heard.

                                   WOOZIE
                         I guess that's our wake up call.
                         Nice meeting you.

Farewell, My Love... (MISSION)



               CJ is at the farm with his car. Catalina gets out of her car
               with a crowbar and kisses a man. Catalina walks over to CJ.

                                   CJ
                         Damn, man, now what?

                                   CATALINA
                         PIG!

                                   CJ
                         What? What'd I do now?

                                   CATALINA
                         Oh, so THIS is where you have
                         been, eh? THIS is how you repay my
                         tenderness! You prefer the curves
                         of some car to those of a real
                         woman?

                                   CJ
                         Look, Catalina, you called it off,
                         remember, 'just business'.

                                   CATALINA
                         What kind of a man are you? When I
                         say 'just business', I mean that I
                         love you!

               Catalina hits CJ's car with the crowbar.

                                   CATALINA
                         When I say, I no interested no
                         more, I mean that I long for you!

               Catalina hits CJ's car with the crowbar again.

                                   CATALINA
                         And when I say that I missed
                         you...!

                                   CJ
                         Wait, Catalina, wait! Leave my car
                         alone, I did this for us, for me
                         and you!

                                   CATALINA
                         It's too late. I don't love you no
                         more. I love another, OK?

                                   CJ
                         What? Then what the fuck was this
                         about?

                                   CATALINA
                         I cannot keep my passions holed
                         up, they need a release. That was
                         a good release, like hitting a man
                         with a frying pan while he sleeps.
                         This, CARL, THIS is my new man.
                             (the man that she kissed
                              earlier)
                         Are you jealous? Are you going to
                         fight for me?

                                   CJ
                         No, no, I can take rejection.

                                   CATALINA
                         You are jealous and a coward! Now
                         let's race!

                                   CJ

                                   CATALINA
                             (to CJ)
                         You had the unfair advantage!

                                   CJ
                         Being a better driver ain't no
                         unfair advantage.

                                   CATALINA
                         You think you're clever, but it is
                         you who is missing the point! Not
                         only was he racing, but he was
                         satisfying me, fully! What are you
                         gonna say about that?

                                   CJ
                         The advantage of a stick shift, I
                         guess. Yeah whatever, anyway, man,
                         what is it, cash or pink slip?

                                   CATALINA
                         There you go!

               Catalina hands CJ a slip of paper.

                                   CATALINA
                         Goodbye Mr. Johnson, I will NOT be

                                   CATALINA
                         The deed to a garage in San

                         Liberty City? Yeah, whatever, have
                         a good time.

                         Holy mother-fucker! Where'd you
                         get that?

               CJ appears with a rocket launcher.

                         Carl, friend, fellow traveller,

                         Well, I'm sorry I'm fucking up
                         your vibe, old man, but I can't

                         Oh, that's a great idea, sis! Why

                         you've wanted something for
                         nothing. Now you've got something,
                         and you don't know what to do with
                         it. Well, make it good enough.

                         Yeah, alright, but how am I gonna
                         find some good mechanics to work
                         up in here, man?

                                   THE TRUTH
                         I know a few guys. Come with me,
                         friend. They're good people, I

                                   CJ
                         Oh, man - I'm about to ride with
                         this fool again?

               CJ and The Truth are outside CJ's garage.

                                   THE TRUTH
                         C'mon, man, there's these two guys
                         I know - used to work on marine
                         engines, 'til the mob bought their
                         business over in Vice. Now they
                         try and make ends meet by taking
                         any old job. They're a little bit
                         dulled by their habit, but the
                         smoke don't get in the way of
                         their skills with an engine. We'll
                         pick up Jethro first. Last I
                         heard, he was working at a garage
                         over Easter Basin way.

               CJ and The Truth pull up at a gas station. Jethro is working
               under a car.

                         Hey, Jethro! Hop in, man. I've
                         landed you a real job.

                         Hey there Truth dude! Oh man, do I
                         owe you? Coz I swear I paid for
                         that weed, dude!

                                   THE TRUTH
                         No, man, we're good, I think.

                         over in Santa Flora district, west
                         of here.

                                   THE TRUTH
                         No. The government is, but that's
                         a long story.

               CJ, The Truth and Jethro pull up outside the hospital.

                         Nothin'. Ooh, don't look. Cover
                         your faces. Think about a yellow
                         rubber duck.

               A van pulls out from the hospital.

                                   CJ

               The van drives past them and goes.

                         OK, I've seen enough. Let's go see
                         if we can find Dwaine. He's

                                   DWAINE
                         Ah yeah, cool man. Uh I've got
                         like some shit to take care of
                         first though. So uh, you tell me

                         freak me out with all that space

                         No, property development! Look,
                         you buy a dump like this, fix it
                         up and sell it. Or better yet, you
                         turn the property into a business.
                         The snowball gets bigger...

                         get on its feet, and when it does,
                         we are gonna have money. If you
                         want to make something of
                         yourself, you gotta let your money
                         work for you.

                         to start.

                         concentrate on the garage, and let
                         me work the property thing, OK?

                         any friends today, thank you.

                         Yes, my hero. Carl, he came back
                         and humiliated me! I shall
                         probably turn to prostitution now,
                         where I will be found dead, and
                         broken. I am a 28 year old man,
                         whose landlord just helped him
                         down from a hook, from which I had
                         been hanging from my underwear,
                         contemplating my inadequacy, for
                         nearly two hours. Ow! Ooh, my

                         What kind of weapons you got?

                         Well with that plane, we gonna go

                                   TENPENNY
                         Yeah, there's some reporter who's
                         digging up dirt on Pulaski, we

               CJ is at the bottom of the stairs. Suzie steps in front of

                         As Dai Dai Lo of the Triad, it is

                         disputes are settled without...
                         damaging important business.

                         on a local Triad that failed to
                         show face at the last Tong

                         lead them to a place quiet and cap
                         their flat asses - no offence.

Amphibious Assault (MISSION)



               CJ and Woozie are upstairs in Woozie's betting shop.

                                   CJ
                         Hold on. You tryin' to tell me you
                         can't swim?

                         Seriously, when I'm in the deep
                         water, it panics me, plus, I'm
                         terrified of eels, and squid, and
                         seaweed, and...

                                   CJ
                         OK dude, see - I know you just
                         trying to make excuses now!

                                   WOOZIE
                         Look, CJ, I need someone from
                         outside the Triad who I can trust.

                                   CJ
                         A'ight, so let me get this
                         straight. You want me to swim
                         around in dirty dock water,
                         dodging little brown jelly beans
                         and Vietnamese gangsters, to put a
                         bug on a boat in the harbour?

                                   WOOZIE
                         You're so negative!

                                   CJ
                         Listen, man - when I was a kid,
                         swimming off the Santa Maria, I
                         once got a condom stuck to my
                         face.

                                   WOOZIE
                             (laughs)

                         Horror like that stays with you
                         for life, believe that.

                             (laughs)
                         I have a confession to make...
                         I... I'm blind.

                                   CJ
                         No shit!

                         Yes, although I've trained my
                         other senses to a point where you
                         wouldn't notice my handicap, in
                         the water they'd be quite useless.

                                   CJ
                         Alright, Woozie, relax. Don't beat
                         yourself up about it. Look, I'll
                         do it. Uh, one last thing. you do
                         know that I'm black, right? And
                         not Chinese.

                                   WOOZIE
                         I'm blind, Carl, not stupid.

               (On screen) You will have to swim to it, however there are Da

               CJ is in the water.

               (On screen) The route ahead is blocked but there is an
               underwater tunnel! You will have to dive and swim through it
               to proceed.

               ///MISSION\\\

               CJ is still in the water.

               (On screen) The main route across the water is guarded by two
               patrol boats. If they spot you, dive underwater to lose their
               attention.

               (On screen) Don't swim on the surface of the water or you will
               be spotted.

                         and one was a match for a car on a
                         customer's wish list. So, he
                         marked the container with a spray
                         can, but it might be too late, the

                             probably won't get one-time
                             involved until it turns ugly.

                             her, or slow her down.

                             pop her crazy bitch tyres and
                             bang her crazy bitch ass in

               CJ is outside Toreno's house. Toreno is nowhere to be seen.

                         you know about my family.

                                   TORENO
                         Now first we need to see what
                         you're made of.

                         No - anger, and hate. And that's

                         speed and commitment. you got a
                         GPS in the cab. Get to each set of
                         map coordinates as quick as you
                         can. Make it to all the
                         coordinates then get the truck
                         back here. Lose the truck and you
                         fail.

                         First, what's a GPS? Second, fail

                         Hey, Carl.

                         Hey, what the fuck, man! Hey,
                         Toreno, I told you my bad, man.
                         What the hell can I say? I screwed
                         you over.

                                   TORENO
                         Calm down, kid.

                                   CJ
                         Just go ahead and kill me then.

                                   TORENO
                         Calm down!

                                   CJ
                         Man, you ain't nothin' but a
                         fucking yayo dealer anyway,
                         Toreno.

                                   TORENO
                         Shut up and sit down! What, you
                         think I'm a drug dealer? You think
                         you're a crusader for good? Do you
                         have any idea what's going on? Any
                         idea whatsoever? Do you? DO YOU?

                                   CJ
                         No. I pay as little attention to
                         things as possible.

                                   TORENO
                         Do not be a fucking smart-ass with
                         me. I work for a government
                         agency. It is not important which
                         one. I will try not to confuse
                         you. Yes, when we last met, I was
                         involved in battling threats in
                         Latin America, BY ANY MEANS
                         NECCESSARY. That does not make me
                         a drug dealer. Now, the money that
                         we raised, the friends that we won
                         over, have helped us immeasurably
                         in our overseas interests.

                                   CJ

                         Kids like you. You expect heroes.
                         We're fighting a war out there.
                         I'll be a hero and I'll lose, and
                         what'll we have? Communism in
                         Ohio. People sharing. Nobody
                         buying stuff. That kind of
                         bullshit. So relax, and listen.

                                   CJ
                         Alright, alright, I'm listening.

                                   TORENO
                         I know what kind of a guy you are.
                         I need a guy like you. To do
                         things I can't get caught doing.

                                   CJ
                         Like what?

                                   TORENO
                         I need you to commandeer a
                         trucker. A rival agency, with a
                         confused social agenda. They got
                         things that we need. Now this is a
                         two-man job. You'll need a friend.
                         Use your sister's boyfriend, but
                         don't tell him a thing. Remember.
                         I'll be watching you.

               Toreno leaves. CUT TO Cesar running towards Toreno's house

                         needed help?

                         Sorry man, I got a whole lot on my

                         Yeah, I'll do you a proper injury,
                         man. What you knowin' about my
                         brother?

                                   TORENO
                         Relax. He's in prison up state, D
                         Wing. Cell 13. To the left I got a
                         child killer, who wants to rip his
                         throat out. To the right of him I
                         got a white supremacist, who wants
                         to eat his heart, to be precise.
                         Now don't worry. Tenpenny and
                         Pulaski are really relatively
                         benign. Unless of course you're a

                         heroes. We have to make decisions,
                         kid. You know, I try to set bad
                         people on other bad people. And
                         sometimes, I let good guys die.
                         He's your brother, but to me, he's
                         just collateral. It's a very
                         delicate decision. Over here, you
                         got all the scumbags inside the
                         country, and over here, you got
                         all the scumbags outside the
                         country. And me and my colleagues.
                         We're the fucking pivot. Keep the
                         government in work. Which reminds
                         me... I need you to head over HERE
                         in the buggy outside.

                         home and finds that his wife and
                         kids have been murdered.
                         Everything's under control. We'll

                         Jesus! Will you stop doing that?

               A helicopter is flying towards the drop zone.

                                   TORENO
                         Hold up. Shit, pilot says he's got
                         trouble, two agency choppers
                         coming in on an intercept. Can you
                         see them?

                                   CJ
                         Yeah.

                                   TORENO
                         Shoot 'em down. Protect the cargo
                         at all costs!

Mike Toreno (BOSS)



Verdant Meadows (MISSION)



               Toreno is sat in his house reading a book. CJ enters.

                                   TORENO
                         It's amazing!

                                   CJ
                         What's up now, Toreno?

                                   TORENO
                         This history. It's all lies. It
                         says Hitler killed himself and
                         that we nuked Japan. And people
                         believe this shit. Jesus. Well, if
                         it makes them sleep better at
                         night, I guess.

                                   CJ
                         Hey man, what did you want? Is you
                         gonna free my brother?

                                   TORENO
                         No. Not now. And here's a little
                         newsflash - I said that to get you
                         to do something for me.

                                   CJ
                         Man, you real fucked up.

                                   TORENO
                         But the shocker is, we are gonna
                         look after him. Because I need him
                         alive as much as you do.

                                   CJ
                         Oh, thanks.

                                   TORENO
                         You know, after what you've done
                         for me, it's like you're a pro
                         now. I got double agents in Panama
                         who want to put a price on your
                         head. A Russian spy - a little,
                         fat, Boris looking guy - he's
                         asking for clearance to
                         interrogate you, Russian style.
                         Callipers on the genitals. Feels
                         good, you'd like it.

                                   CJ
                         That ain't nothing cool, man! Just
                         leave me alone. You're bad news!

                                   TORENO
                         Don't worry about it. The Russians
                         got bigger things to worry about
                         than your genitals, believe me.
                         The whole country went to shit. We
                         tried hard to put a lid on it, but
                         that idiot Gorbachev, with the
                         little strawberry on his forehead,
                         he gave away the crown jewels.
                         Still, they got their, you know,
                         boy in the White House. That was
                         nice...

                                   CJ
                         So? What you want me to do?

                                   TORENO
                         Listen, I need you to buy some
                         property, OK. Shouldn't cost that
                         much. You offer them a dollar. If
                         they give you a hard time, kill
                         them. I'm going to need you to
                         start doing some real wet work
                         here for me soon, OK? Enough of
                         this little girl bullshit. Now get
                         out of here.



               Between missions.



               CJ is at the airfield. His phone rings.

                                   TORENO
                         Hey, Carl! So what do you think of
                         our new base of operations?

                                   CJ
                         It's missing something. Maybe a
                         tennis court and a pool would help
                         motivate me better.

                                   TORENO
                         Very nice, Carl, very cute. Now
                         listen, you're going to have to
                         learn how to fly.

                                   CJ
                         No I ain't.

                                   TORENO
                         Yes, actually, you are. I've set
                         out a series of tests for you. You
                         can access them on that TV. You're
                         going to have to prove to me you
                         can fly if you're going to
                         continue working towards your
                         brother's freedom.

                                   CJ
                         Shit. Whatever, man...

                                   TORENO
                         Very nice.

               CJ is at the airfield. Toreno sneaks up behind CJ and grabs
               him.

                                   TORENO
                         Got you again, Carl. You're half
                         asleep. I could have killed you in
                         9 different ways. Wake up and
                         smell the coffee.

                                   CJ
                         You need to lay off the coffee.

                                   TORENO
                         We got a problem. I got some guys
                         out in the field need some
                         equipment. If they don't get it,
                         they'll be dead by nightfall.

                                   CJ
                         Then take it to them.

                                   TORENO
                         Me take it to them?

                                   CJ
                         Yeah, why not?

                                   TORENO
                         I got five guys watching me all
                         the time. Two in that hill. One
                         over there and two by satellite.
                         If I go my guys and I will be
                         dead. I don't have a death wish.
                         I'm a man of peace, son.

                                   CJ
                         Yeah, clearly.

                                   TORENO
                         Take the plane. You're not ready
                         yet so stay low under the radar.
                         Questions?

                                   CJ
                         Yeah, just one thing...

                                   TORENO
                         Get to it.

                                   CJ
                         Wait. Hey. Listen! Listen to me
                         for once. Why won't these guys
                         come after me?

                                   TORENO
                         Oh, they can't because they're all
                         posted on me. One DEA. One FBI. A
                         Russian, a Cuban double agent and
                         my paymasters. Cheques and
                         balances. Nobody is watching
                         anybody watching nobody. You know
                         what I mean? Go.

                                   CJ
                         Whatever, man.

Stowaway (MISSION)



               CJ is at the airfield. Three cars and a plane come onto the
               airstrip.

                                   CJ
                         Ah, what's Toreno up to? I'm
                         feeling a little exposed here!

               CJ hides behind some crates. The agents are patrolling the
               airstrip. Toreno sneaks up behind CJ, also hiding behind the
               crates.

                                   TORENO
                         What's your take on this?

                                   CJ
                             (startled at the sudden
                              appearance of Toreno)
                         Damn!
                             (normal)
                         I thought they was your people.

                                   TORENO
                         Listen, Carl. We've got a problem.
                         Some traitors from another
                         department think they can help the
                         'overseas situation' by financing
                         militaristic dictators in exchange
                         for arms contacts.

                                   CJ
                         Hey, ain't that exactly what you
                         do?

                                   TORENO
                         Well, kind of, but we get to pick
                         our dictators. Degenerates that we
                         can control. We try to stay the
                         hell away from these guys with
                         principles, because that just -
                         muddies the waters.

                                   CJ
                         Yeah, OK.

                                   TORENO
                         OK, so, of course these idiots
                         have stolen a consignment of land
                         mines and they plan to offload
                         them in the Middle East, and
                         cause a little ruckus...
                             (rambling)
                         And everybody goes crazy and has a
                         lot of problems...
                             (normal)
                         Carl, do you like maiming people?
                         Just curious...

                                   CJ
                         Maiming? Some people, shit...

                                   TORENO
                         Anyway, the point is - you and me,
                         Carl, we're the same. Now yeah,
                         it's a dirty job, but somebody's
                         got to do it. But if you screw
                         this up, it cause a tinder box
                         situation all over Latin America
                         and the Middle East. Now look, I
                         spoke to the big man. You've got
                         clearance to eliminate these
                         fuckers. How's that?

                                   CJ
                         Huh, man, kill Government agents?

                                   TORENO
                         Kill, schmill. Come on... don't
                         look at it that way, will you?
                         Think of it as pest control. It
                         works for me. All right, come on,
                         I can't stay here now. I'm too
                         hip, I gotta go. OK? I'm outta
                         here.

               (On screen) Toreno needs you to plant a bomb in the plane.
               Stealth is out of the question so you'll need to move fast.

               (On screen) Use this bike to get up the plane's ramp and plant
               the bomb inside.

               (On screen) Drive the bike up the plane's ramp before it takes
               off.

               ///MISSION\\\

               The plane takes off.

               (On screen) You're trapped on the plane.

               ///MISSION\\\

               CJ jumps off the plane as it explodes.



The Truth (BOSS)



Black Project (MISSION)



               CJ is at the airfield. The Truth is on top of an old piece of
               plane.

                                   THE TRUTH
                         Hail fellow, well met. Amaste.
                         Peace. Carl, brother.

                                   CJ
                         Hey, Truth, where you at?

                                   THE TRUTH
                         Just checking that you were no
                         longer on 'government business'.
                         Where is he?

                                   CJ
                         How the fuck would I know, man?
                         He's like the devil. Hey, man, you
                         OK?

                                   THE TRUTH
                         Everything is transient.

               The Truth jumps down from the old piece of plane.

                                   THE TRUTH
                         Oof. Oh, man. Uh. I'm passing
                         through life, same as every man.

                                   CJ
                         OK.

                                   THE TRUTH
                         Do you have any idea what you're
                         doing for Toreno?

                                   CJ
                         No. I seem to be on a need-to-know
                         basis.

                                   THE TRUTH
                         Oh, no, man. Two lies don't cancel
                         each other out. You know that. We
                         pay them to lie to us. Is that
                         what our founding fathers wanted?
                         No more, friend. No more. We're
                         not alone.

                                   CJ
                         Get off me, man, what's going on?

                                   THE TRUTH
                         Everything is going on! Don't you
                         get it? There's a place. Not even
                         on the map. A train is about to
                         leave. It can explain better than
                         I ever can. Boy, this is going to
                         blow your fucking mind! We got
                         work to do. You better drive. I'll
                         explain. Elegance does not even
                         touch it.

               CJ and The Truth are in the Mothership outside Area 69.

                                   CJ
                         Do we have a plan here?

                                   THE TRUTH
                         Go, go, go!

               CJ gets out of the Mothership.

                                   CJ
                         HEY! Hold up, dude!

               The Truth drives away.

               (On screen) The Truth wants you to gain entry to the Area 69
               research lab and bring back to him the Black Project that is
               being developed inside.

               (On screen) The easiest way into the Area 69 bunker complex is
               through the blast doors. To open these go to the control
               tower.

               (On screen) There are searchlights sweeping the area. Observe
               their routine and plan your route around them. If you stay in
               a searchlight for too long or shoot more than 2 out you will
               be spotted. The blast doors will go on lockdown, and an
               alternative route inside will then have to be found.

               (On screen) There are also several military personnel
               patrolling the area. Use the thermal goggles that The Truth
               gave you to help you see them in the dark.

               (On screen) You can use stealth to avoid patrols or climb to
               the top of a control tower and use your sniper rifle to take
               them out.

               ///MISSION\\\

               (On screen) Make your way through Area 69 to the research lab
               which will give you access to the black project.

               (On screen) There are several military personnel on patrol
               throughout the installation.

               (On screen) The control room will allow you to deactivate some
               of area 69's exterior defences, which will aid your escape.

               ///MISSION\\\

               CJ is wearing a jet pack.

               (On screen) You've found what The Truth wanted. You must
               escape by using the Jet pack to fly out of the launch bay
               directly above you.

               ///MISSION\\\

               The Truth is in the Mothership on top of a canyon. CJ is stood
               near the Mothership.

                                   THE TRUTH
                         Carl, dude, man!

                                   CJ
                         Here you go, better stash it
                         someplace fast!

                                   THE TRUTH
                         Far out, have a nice trip, dude!

               The Truth drives away.

                                   CJ
                         Hey, wait a... Was it too much to
                         get a lift into town?

               The Truth enters on the jet pack narrowly missing CJ who had
               to get out of the way.

                         Oh, I can hardly wait. I hear

                         Man, I've tried, but I can't fly
                         for shit. You better do it. Land

                         starting to think you was a
                         lunatic. What do you mean, you
                         don't know yet?

                         Idiot! Do you realize how much
                         those machines cost? We're
                         supposed to be opening in -
                             (to the worker)
                         What the fuck was that?

                                   WOOZIE
                         Carl, glad you could make it.

                                   CJ
                         So this is what you've been doing.

                                   WOOZIE
                         Yeah, it's been a complete
                         nightmare. You want a stomach
                         ulcer, try opening a Triad casino
                         in a Mafia-run town!

                                   WOOZIE
                         Yeah - the corporations are moving
                         in and everybody's feeling the
                         squeeze. I've had slot machines
                         busted up, workmen being scared
                         off...

                                   CJ
                         So who's behind this?

                                   WOOZIE
                         Well, there are these three mob
                         families operating here, and each
                         of them has a stake in Caligula's
                         Casino and some whacked-out
                         lawyer's running it for them. It
                         could be any one of them, or all
                         of 'em.

                                   WOOZIE
                         No. In addition to the usual
                         authorities that need bribing,
                         each one would want a slice and
                         I'm not about to hand over all our

                         That's right, you heard me. I want
                         to offer you a share in our
                         casino, in exchange for some help
                         setting it up. How does that
                         sound, partner?

               CJ enters the casino's garage. Johnny is tied to the front of
               a car.

                         not joking here - untie me,
                         mother-fucker.

               CJ gets in the car.

Explosive Situation (MISSION)



               Woozie is in the casino playing golf. Suzie is holding the cup
               that Woozie is aiming for. Woozie misses the cup but Suzie
               moves the cup to where the golf ball is going. CJ is also in
               the casino.

                                   WOOZIE
                         Ha ha ha! The glorious sound of a
                         hole in one!

                                   SUZIE
                         Great shot, boss!

                                   WOOZIE
                         Thanks.

                                   CJ
                         Not bad, Woozie.

                                   WOOZIE
                         So the Sindacco Family was behind
                         the attempts to sabotage our
                         venture. I wonder why it's only
                         them and not the others?

                                   CJ
                         Probably ain't just them. Rule of

                         need... is to hit the Mafia
                         casino. Yeah, go jack the place.

                                   WOOZIE
                         Hey, hitting a casino isn't like
                         gangbanging - it's a whole
                         different league!

                                   CJ
                         Yeah, you're right, it'll take
                         some planning, but I'm down. Shit,
                         I always wanted to pull a heist.

               CJ takes a shot with the golf club. The ball is heading
               towards the cup but Suzie rolls the cup out of the way.

                                   CJ
                         What the -?

                         Bad luck. Listen, you're gonna
                         need a crew and some special
                         equipment.

                         Yeah, it'll take some explosives.

                         Oh I know! I know!

                                   CJ
                         Spit it out, filthy worm!

                                   MILLIE
                         You'll never break me!

                                   CJ
                         Hey, if you good, I'll punish you
                         more.

                                   MILLIE
                         Oh Benny, you minx!

               The camera is focused on the outside of Millie's house. CJ and
               Millie are having sex inside. Millie is moaning with pleasure
               while CJ is complaining about how sickening her sex acts are.

Dam And Blast (MISSION)



               CJ, Woozie, Suzie, Zero, one of Woozie's assistants, the
               occupant of the room and two other men are in the planning
               room.

                                   CJ
                         It seems impossible to keep a
                         secret around here! I would have
                         thought the size of the room would
                         keep the numbers down.

                                   MAN 1
                         Hey, speak up, we can't hear you
                         back here!

                                   CJ
                         I appreciate your input, but
                         please, fuck off.

                                   MAN 1
                         What did he say?

                                   MAN 2
                         He said fuck off.
                             (murmurs)

               Man 1 and man 2 leave.

                                   CJ
                             (to the occupant)
                         Hey, what are you still doing
                         here?

                                   OCCUPANT
                         I live here.

                                   CJ
                         Oh, OK, you can stay.

                                   OCCUPANT
                         Great.

                                   SUZIE
                         Hey, where's the coffee and
                         doughnuts?

               CJ purposely ignores Suzie.

                                   CJ
                         OK, look, I'm going to go shut off
                         the city's power source. Woozie,
                         look after these fools for me.

                                   WOOZIE
                         OK, now, the important thing to
                         remember with a plan like this, is
                         that... nothing can go wrong.

               ///MISSION\\\

               CJ parachutes out of a plane. The plane crashes after CJ has
               jumped out.

               ///MISSION\\\

               (On screen) Make your way to the end of the dam quay.

               (On screen) Avoid getting spotted by the guards patrolling in
               the area

               (On screen) There's a knife stashed near one of the containers
               which you may find useful.

               ///MISSION\\\

               (On screen) This is all about stealth, if you get spotted or

                         Any sign of him yet?

                             (on the other end of the
                              phone)
                         Not yet, but we've locked the quay
                         entrance and the cops are on the
                         way.

               ///MISSION\\\

               CJ is on top of one of the dam's towers.

                                   CJ
                         Shit, they must have took a wrong
                         turn someplace! What the f... - aw
                         shit, somebody done locked the
                         hatch!

                         We've got him trapped, there's no
                         way off that ledge!

               Police surround the dam. CJ dives off the dam tower and into
               the water.



Heist Missions (BOSS)



Cop Wheels (MISSION)



               CJ, Woozie, Suzie, one of Woozie's assistants, Zero and the
               occupant of the room are in the planning room in the casino.
               CJ is standing in front of the layout of Caligula's Casino.

                                   CJ
                         Alright, here's the plan. It's all
                         about the art of deception. While
                         I get as much heat on me as
                         possible, y'all get away with the
                         green.

                                   ZERO
                         Question: how does the Mafia
                         normally move cash out of
                         Caligula's?

                                   CJ
                         Bingo! Stripes for Mr. Zero here.

                                   OCCUPANT
                         Ha hey! Good job, you little ass
                         kisser!

               The occupant pats Zero on the back.

                                   ZERO
                             (moans in pain)

                                   CJ
                         So, we're going to steal ourselves
                         an armoured car and re-spray it so
                         it looks like one of their regular
                         trucks.

                                   SUZIE
                         What about the police escorts?
                         Whenever they move cash around
                         they use police motorcycles as
                         outriders.

                                   CJ
                         Exactly what I was thinking.
                         C'mon, come with me, and we're
                         gonna go get some cop wheels...

               CUT TO CJ and Suzie outside the casino.

                                   CJ
                         You get the Packer, hit the Julius
                         Thruway and keep moving.

               ///MISSION\\\

               CJ jumps off the Packer which has four police motorbikes on
               it. Suzie and an assistant are in the front of the Packer.

                                   CJ
                         OK, that should do us. Take care
                         of those bikes. Now get out of
                         here!

Up, Up And Away! (MISSION)



               The usual six men that are planning the heist are in the
               planning room in the casino. CJ is at the front giving out
               instructions.

                                   CJ
                         OK, we got the bikes. And Woozie's
                         taken care of the uniforms. Now,
                         we just gotta get an armoured van
                         and re-spray it with the
                         Caligula's Casino logo.

                                   WOOZIE
                         Why don't we steal one while it's
                         on its rounds? That way we can
                         make some money too.

                                   CJ
                         No, I don't want to get the crew
                         caught up in some street level
                         jacking - it could get ugly.

                                   ZERO
                         I... I have an idea? Um... Have
                         you ever seen those helicopters
                         they use to lift heavy loads?

                                   SUZIE
                         Yeah, they call 'em 'sky cranes'.
                         We could lift the whole truck and
                         take them to someplace safe.

                                   WOOZIE
                         Then we need to steal a sky crane.
                         Unfortunately I'm not a pilot.

                                   ZERO
                         No, me neither.

                                   SUZIE
                         Hey, don't look at me.

                                   ASSISTANT
                         Or me.

                                   CJ
                         Shit. I'll fly it, then. We can
                         re-spray it at the airstrip.

                                   ZERO
                         Yeah, Carl. It'll be just like
                         fighting Berkley, only bigger!

                                   CJ
                         Yeah, thanks for that.

               ///MISSION\\\

               CJ gets out of the sky crane at the airfield. Suzie comes
               along.

                                   SUZIE
                         Heeey, CJ, you never cease to
                         amaze me!

                                   CJ
                         Heh heh, good lookin', where's
                         Woozie?

                                   SUZIE
                         I don't know. He insisted on
                         driving here himself. He could be
                         anywhere.

                                   CJ
                         Ha ha, yeah I guess. Alright,
                         dude, I'm outta here. I'll see
                         y'all later.



The Triads (BOSS)



You've Had Your Chips (MISSION)



               CJ and Woozie are playing cards in the casino.

                                   WOOZIE
                         Hit me!

                                   CJ
                         Are you sure, man?

                                   WOOZIE
                         Yeah, I'm going for a five card
                         hand! Come on...

                                   CJ
                         OK, here. I'm gonna stick. What
                         you got?

                                   WOOZIE
                         How would I know? You tell me.

                                   CJ
                         Not good, man. You got, eerr,
                         forty-seven.

                                   WOOZIE
                         Damn. You're bad luck for me. You
                         know, when I play the other guys I
                         always win!

               One of Woozie's assistants enter.

                                   ASSISTANT
                         Boss, take a look at these two
                         chips!

                                   WOOZIE
                         One's a fake.

                                   CJ
                         That's amazing. You didn't even
                         touch them.

                                   WOOZIE
                         No. I just took a guess. Why else
                         would he come in with two chips
                         and sound so worried? You take a
                         look.

                                   CJ
                         Oh yeah. The dragon on this got
                         the sunglasses and a white stick.

                                   WOOZIE
                         Insolent bastards!

                                   ASSISTANT
                         I'll make sure the cashiers are
                         extra vigilant.

                                   WOOZIE
                         It's obvious where these chips are
                         coming from! The Sindacco Family
                         owns a plastic factory across

The Truth (BOSS)



Don Peyote (MISSION)



               CJ is outside the casino. His phone rings.

                                   CJ
                         Hello.

                                   THE TRUTH
                         Who am I speaking to?

                                   CJ
                         It's CJ. Hey, Truth, is that you?

                                   THE TRUTH
                         Might be. Might be a government
                         algorithm trying to pick your
                         brains, so don't admit anything!

                                   CJ
                         Whatever, man. Whassup?

                                   THE TRUTH
                         I need a favour, Carl, thought I
                         could cash in some karma chips.

                                   CJ
                         Your credit good.

                                   THE TRUTH
                         I took some fellow travellers deep
                         into the desert on a peyote safari
                         a few nights back. We faced the
                         inner light and communed with the
                         lizard king.

                                   CJ
                         Sounds fun. How did it go?

                                   THE TRUTH
                         That's the problem, I don't know.
                         I'm in Los Santos. I woke up in a
                         Japanese bathhouse about an hour
                         ago. I have no idea how I got here
                         or where the others are.

                                   CJ
                         They're probably fine.

                                   THE TRUTH
                         I don't think so. They were Brits
                         - a band and their managers. They
                         have no experience about the
                         desert.

                                   CJ
                         OK, where'd you make camp? I can
                         go have a look.

                                   THE TRUTH
                         I took 'em up Arco del Oeste -
                         fantastic sunsets. Best start
                         looking for them up there.

                                   MACCER
                         I dunno, mate. I was having a
                         dream; I was wanking over some fat
                         bird's tits when this twat turned
                         up.

                         Maccer, you fucking psycho! You

                         I've told you a million times not
                         to put stuff in my fucking drink!

                         Who are you again?

                                   CJ
                         Oh, I'm a friend of The Truth's.
                         He said you guys might need a ride
                         into town or something.

                                   MACCER
                         But I'm a fucking raspberry!

                                   PAUL

                         I can't feel me legs, our P. I've
                         wanked the use out of them!

                                   PAUL
                         Just stand up, you soppy cunt. We
                         go through this every weekend.

               Maccer tries to stand up.

                                   MACCER
                         Ah! Ooh!

                                   CJ
                         Man, what the hell was y'all doing
                         last night?

                         Anybody got a rag?

               Paul hands Maccer a rag. CJ turns away and sighs disgustedly.

                                   CJ
                         So, where am I taking y'all?

                                   PAUL
                         I've got a pal, Rosie. He's got
                         some casino gig going down in
                         Venturas. Sweet.

                                   CJ
                         Alright.

               Maccer goes to hand Paul the rag back.

                                   PAUL
                         Fuck off, string.

                                   MACCER

                         fucking typical even to mention.

                                   PAUL
                         It's alright, bruv, Paulo can
                         help. Give us some space would
                         you, son. I'll give you a tinkle
                         later.

                                   CJ
                         Alright, for sure.

                                   PAUL
                         Not you, Maccer.

                                   MACCER
                         Oh, you twat.

                                   PAUL
                         Unbelievable.

               CJ is outside Caligula's Casino. He phones Woozie.

                                   CJ
                         Hey Woozie. I think I found a way
                         to scope Caligula's without
                         causing too much suspicion. We can
                         talk later.



The Mafia (BOSS)



Intensive Care (MISSION)



               Maccer, Paul and Rosie are in Rosie's room in Caligula's
               Casino. Rosie's assistant is at the door. CJ enters.

                                   PAUL
                         Oi, Rosie, liven yourself up,
                         Carl's here.

                                   ROSIE
                         Hello.

                                   CJ
                         What's happenin'?

                                   MACCER
                         Eh, there's some top fanny down at
                         that pool, Pabsy.

                                   PAUL
                         Leave it out, dimlo, what's wrong
                         with you?
                             (to Rosie, regarding CJ)
                         Well are you going to tell him, or
                         shall I?

                                   ROSIE
                         I'm really screwed.

                                   PAUL
                         Crack on, Rosie - spit it out.

                                   ROSIE
                         I threw it all away. OK, I had the
                         power, the money, the ladies...
                         But I couldn't lay off the blow,
                         so I went into rehab. And
                         everything went to shit, but so
                         what? So when I came out I started
                         representing the Liberty City mob,
                         again and that's how I ended up
                         here. But, no one family would
                         trust another family to run the
                         casino, so I was put forth as a
                         neutral party. So now I spend my
                         days waiting for one family to cap
                         me and blame the other one. My
                         only friend is a bird named Tony.

                                   TONY
                             (the parrot)
                         I never fucked anyone over in my
                         life who didn't have it coming to
                         'em.

                                   CJ
                         Shit - let me think about this.
                         You're gonna have to break it down
                         for me real quick.

                                   ROSIE
                         OK, OK - the Sindaccos are on the
                         warpath. OK? I mean, something
                         terrible has happened to Johnny. I
                         mean, he's in a shock-induced coma
                         at the hospital across town. Now
                         the Forellis - they will take this
                         opportunity to rub him out. Now if
                         any hit between the families
                         succeeds on my turf, I will get
                         the axe, bullet, machete,
                         whatever...

                                   CJ
                         OK, OK, relax. I'm gonna shoot
                         over to the hospital, and move the
                         body or something.

                                   PAUL
                         There you go, my love, things
                         ain't so bad, are they?

                                   RECEPTIONIST
                         Mr. Sindacco? There must be some
                         mistake. An ambulance just picked
                         him up.

                                   CJ
                         Oh, OK. Thank you for your help.

               ///MISSION\\\

               CJ is in an ambulance outside the meat factory. Johnny is in
               the back. Two men come to collect Johnny.

                         He's doing much better, yeah. He
                         ate something this morning.

               Johnny comes out of his room in a wheelchair.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Heeyyy, Ken... Ah, Christ, this

                         night terrors, touch of diarrhoea,
                         but I'll get through it.

                         Aaargghh! My heart! Euchh... my

                                   TENPENNY
                         Hello, Carl. Been a long time,
                         huh?

                                   CJ
                         Yeah, I was starting to miss you
                         guys.

                                   TENPENNY
                         Now why don't I believe you? Get
                         over here! Now things have
                         developed since the last time we
                         met. Despite our best efforts the

                         ourselves out of the hole.

                         on you.

                         Getting a little edgy, fellas?

               Tenpenny punches CJ in the stomach. CJ falls to the ground.

                                   TENPENNY

                         shit? That give you any idea how
                         edgy I am?

               The barbecue's flame blasts out.

                         Woah! What the fuck?

                             (to CJ)
                         Get up, bitch! You paying
                         attention? Now there's a ruined
                         town out west of here, Aldea
                         Malvada. And there's some piece of
                         shit DEA officer meeting with an
                         FBI agent with a dossier. Now you

               Zero is waiting in the downstairs room where the heist van
               entered. There is the heist van and two police motorbikes.

                                   ZERO
                         I've unloaded the police bikes.
                         Everybody in! You two, change into
                         your police uniforms!

               Two of the men get onto the police motorbikes in police
               uniforms. The other two get into the heist van and they all
               drive away.

               CJ is at the airfield, as are the heist van and the two police

               airfield.

                                   CJ
                         Zero, where you hiding?

               Zero comes out from behind the back of the heist van.

                                   ZERO
                         I didn't mean to tell Berkley, it
                         just kinda came out... is all.

               CJ punches Zero to the floor.

                                   ZERO
                         Will you watch it, you idiot!

The Triads (BOSS)



A Home In The Hills (MISSION)



               CJ, Woozie and Kendl are in the casino giving auditions to
               people for shows. There is currently a midget auditioning.

                                   MIDGET
                             (singing)
                         Don't hate the little man, because
                         he's packing a 6 shooter!

                                   KENDL
                         Next.

                                   CJ
                         Thank you.

                                   MIDGET
                         Thank you? Thank you?! Do you know
                         how much balls it takes to stand
                         down here and sing a song like
                         that? It takes guts!

                                   WOOZIE
                         I'm sorry. We're just looking for
                         something with a little more mass
                         appeal.

                                   MIDGET
                         What could have more mass appeal
                         than a song like "Small But
                         Perfectly Formed"? Women want me.
                         Men want to be like me! Assholes!

               The midget exits.

                         Damn! This casino game is hard
                         work. I thought it was just a case
                         of opening the doors and letting
                         suckers give you their money.

                                   WOOZIE

                         here. I'm trying to do business,
                         not audition midgets.

                         Yeah, yeah, I said that. All I
                         know is, when are we gonna get
                         some real talent in here?

                                   CJ
                         I heard that.

               Madd Dogg enters.

                         I want to go home now, CJ.

                                   CJ
                         That's cool, man, I'll take you.
                         Where's home?

                                   CJ
                         We could do with a place like that
                         to set up in LS again, wait for
                         Sweet. Get things moving. Get out

Home Coming (MISSION)



               CJ is in the recording studio at Madd Dogg's Crib. He is on
               the phone.

                                   CJ
                         I don't care 'how', I care 'when'.

               Toreno walks up behind CJ.

                                   CJ
                         As in 'now'. You hear me?

               Toreno takes CJ's phone out of his hand.

                                   CJ
                         Hey, man, what the - ?

                                   TORENO
                         Hello, boss man. Taking care of
                         business I see.

                                   CJ
                         Toreno, fuck you. I almost lost my
                         life out there for you.

                                   TORENO
                         I've just got one tiny little
                         thing for you to do, then I'm out
                         of your life forever.

               CJ pulls out a gun and points it at Toreno.

                                   CJ
                         You know what? I'm tired of your
                         fucking little jobs.

                                   TORENO
                         Oh, will you stop? This is
                         pathetic, come on. You're
                         embarrassing yourself. Come on,
                         put it down. Don't be ridiculous,
                         OK?

               Toreno pushes the gun down.

                                   TORENO
                         Hey, I got a little surprise for

               CJ's phone rings.

                         Answer it.

               CJ answers the phone.

                         right there.

               CJ puts the phone down.

                         So what was that little job you

                         and for you, bro.

                                   SWEET
                         For Grove Street, baby.

                                   CJ
                         Yeah, for the Grove, baby.

                                   SWEET
                         Hey - if you need me, you know
                         where I'll be.

                                   CJ
                         For sure. You've always been there
                         for me, man.

               (On screen) Security is tight in the Crack Fortress. There is
               only one way in but the door is locked down because of the
               riots. The only way past that reinforced entrance is to knock
               it down.

               (On screen) A heavy vehicle like the SWAT Tank will be able to
               smash down the entrance easily.

               Big Smoke is in his room on floor 4 of his crack house,
               playing on his computer console. CJ walks up behind him.

                                   CJ
                         Hey, Smoke!

                                   BIG SMOKE
                         Hey, CJ, I was wondering when
                         you'd show up.

                                   CJ
                         How'd you know it was me?

                                   BIG SMOKE
                         Knew it was my old dog CJ. Knew
                         you was coming and I don't give a
                         shit.

                                   CJ
                         I'm here to take care of your fat
                         ass, then I'm gonna take care of
                         your friends in the police
                         department. Where they at?

                                   BIG SMOKE
                         Man, fuck this shit.

               Big Smoke puts down the computer pad and proceeds to inhale
               some drugs.

                                   BIG SMOKE
                         Man, that's some good shit...

               CJ starts to talk about Tenpenny.

                                   BIG SMOKE
                         Fuck Tenpenny and fuck his Polish
                         lap dog, and fuck the police, man.
                         All that's old shit. Look at you,
                         you got the whole world. I ain't
                         got no regrets, man.

               CJ begins to talk again but is cut short by Big Smoke.

                                   BIG SMOKE
                         I made it, CJ! I'm a success. I
                         can't be touched! I don't give a
                         fuck. Fuck the whole world.

                                   CJ
                         What happened to you, man?

                                   BIG SMOKE
                         Man, what the fuck do you care?
                         Guess we better do this shit
                         then...

               Big Smoke pulls out a gun.

               ///MISSION\\\

               Big Smoke is sat against a wall, coughing and bleeding. CJ is
               crouched down next to him.

                                   CJ
                         Hey, Smoke, what made you flip out
                         like that, man? Was it the drugs,
                         or what?

                                   BIG SMOKE
                         I got caught up in the money, the
                         power... I don't give a shit. Oh
                         fuck, man...

                                   CJ
                         Why you just didn't quit, man? We
                         was like family, homie.

                                   BIG SMOKE
                         I had no choice... I had to do
                         it... I just see the opportunity.
                         When I'm gone, everyone gonna
                         remember my name... Big Smoke!

               Big Smoke dies.

                                   CJ
                         Oh, damn, man... What a waste.

               Tenpenny enters, holding a gun.

                                   TENPENNY
                         Carl Johnson. My man. I need you
                         to do me another favour. You
                         killed Pulaski, and now this fat
                         fuck - there's no stopping you!
                         Drop the gun.

               CJ drops his gun.

                                   CJ
                         You ain't leaving here alive, man.

                                   TENPENNY
                         Where's your brother at, huh?

                                   CJ
                         Why you just didn't shoot me in
                         the back? Feeling exposed, huh?

                                   TENPENNY
                         Shut your dumb ass up and load the
                         bag. C'mon, let's go, I ain't got
                         time to fuck with you!

                                   CJ
                         So what it's like, Tenpenny, huh?
                         All alone, nobody got your back?
                         Suck, huh?

               CJ starts loading Big Smoke's money into Tenpenny's bag.

                                   TENPENNY
                         Why you think I'm alone? I got a
                         couple of rookies outside. But I
                         gotta open their eyes slowly, you
                         know - a little truth here, a
                         little truth there... A'ight, fuck
                         it, that's enough. Chuck it over,
                         I've got a firetruck to catch.

                                   CJ
                         You're crazy man, you've lost
                         it... you're gone.

                                   TENPENNY
                         Half the city is looking for cops
                         to kill, Carl, and I ain't about
                         to get dragged out of a patrol car
                         and get beaten to death by some
                         angry mob. Not tonight.

                                   CJ
                         What you catching, a plane?

                                   TENPENNY
                         Ding ding ding ding ding! Good
                         answer, Carl! You know, you're
                         gonna thank me one day, for
                         opening your fucking eyes. Oh! I
                         almost forgot, Carl! Time to die!

                                   CJ
                         Uh, Sweet!

               Tenpenny turns around, Sweet isn't there, CJ dives behind a
               chair.

                                   TENPENNY
                         What? Mother-f-

               Tenpenny fires his gun to where CJ was but misses CJ.

                                   TENPENNY
                         It ain't over, Carl! It ain't
                         over!

               Tenpenny runs out of the room with his bag full of money. CUT
               TO Tenpenny on a downstairs floor. He fires a bullet into a
               piece of machinery.

                                   TENPENNY
                         Carl, you mother-fucking piece of
                         shit gang-banging cock-sucker!

               (On screen) Tenpenny has caused an explosion, the lighting in
               the building is off and the whole place is beginning to burn
               down. You need to get out of here quick!

               ///MISSION\\\

               CJ dives out of Big Smoke's crack house as it is exploding
               behind him. Sweet is outside. Tenpenny gets into a fire
               engine.

                                   SWEET
                         Tenpenny, you mother-fucking piece
                         of shit!

               Sweet jumps onto the ladder on the back of the fire engine and
               hangs on as Tenpenny is driving away.

                                   SWEET
                         I ain't letting you get away with
                         all you've done!

                                   CJ
                         Sweet, no!

               ///MISSION\\\

               The fire engine with Tenpenny still in it goes over the edge
               of a bridge and lands on the road in Grove Street. Tenpenny
               stumbles out of the fire engine.

                                   TENPENNY
                         Come on, assholes. I'll take you
                         all. You're mine! Mine! I run this
                         town! Hey, over here! Hey! Officer
                         down! Come on! HEY! Assholes! You
                         never understood what I did! Fifty
                         of me and this town would be OK. I
                         took the trash out! I DID! And I'd
                         do it all again...

               Tenpenny is coughing on the floor. CJ, Sweet, Cesar and Kendl
               appear. CJ is pointing a gun at Tenpenny.

                                   SWEET
                         Don't... don't do it man, he's
                         gone.

                                   CJ
                         I just wanna be sure it's over,
                         man. That's all.

                                   SWEET
                         It's cool, don't need to put a
                         bullet in him. He killed his self
                         in a traffic accident. No one to
                         blame. Let's roll.

               The Truth appears.

                                   THE TRUTH
                         I mean, far out, man. You know, I
                         mean, you beat the system! I tried
                         for thirty years to cross over but
                         you've managed it, man. I mean,
                         man, you're an icon, man!

                                   CJ
                         Oh - thanks, man.

                         I'm just glad it's finally over.

                                   SWEET
                         What's up with Smoke?

                                   CJ
                         You know what's up with Smoke. He
                         always saw things a little
                         different than us.

                                   KENDL
                         Smoke? Smoke was always on his
                         own, always out for self.

                                   THE TRUTH
                         That is the surest path to hell,
                         man. Well - that or fifteen
                         microdots and an ounce of
                         mescaline.

                         Let's go get something to eat.

                                   SWEET
                         Sounds good to me.

               Sweet, Cesar, Kendl and The Truth walk away. CJ stays and goes
               over to Tenpenny who is laying dead on the floor.

                                   CJ
                         See you around. Officer.

               CJ, Cesar, Kendl, Sweet and The Truth are in CJ's house.

                                   CJ
                         Now that everything is cool, we
                         gotta stay on top of our game.
                         Keep everything in check, but
                         subtle.

                                   KENDL
                         We got problems in Venturas,
                         problems in San Fierro. Shit's
                         never ending.

                                   SWEET
                         For sure. I mean, the Families is
                         back on their feet. But we gotta
                         keep shit tight cuz a lot of
